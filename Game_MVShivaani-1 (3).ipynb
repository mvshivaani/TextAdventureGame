    "    A) Introduction: The game is about auction of delinquent storage units in the Golden State.\n",
    "    Bidder is given just once chance to bid, if he has the highest bid, he owns the locker.\n",
    "    Every locker has 10 (blind)items, successful bidder will choose 6 items, remaining 4 will go to auction house as fee.\n",
    "    Out of 6, one is a 'supposed collectible' that needs to be appraised. \n",
    "    If bidder's total payoff is positive, the aprraiser asks him to accompamy him to Vegas to bet on roulette.\n",
    "    Are you curious to know:\n",
    "    Does the bidder get the locker?\n",
    "    Does his gamble payoff?\n",
    "    Does he get to Vegas?\n",
    "    Does he get to own money or money owns him???\n",
